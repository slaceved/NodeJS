# BrainTree Local Payment Processing Server

This code base is highly based on the "braintree-node" project which can be located on the BrainTree [git]("https://github.com/braintree/braintree_node.git") repository.

To run tests:
  npm test


TBD:
* complete mocha debug
* add jade test UI and debug
* add API documentation file
